# Filter_Differential_Pressure
Case: Vedanta Aluminium Limited 4*600 MW Captive Power Plant(Thermal)
Phase 1 of the plant has 48 Fabric Bag filter compartments divided into 4 passes with 12 compartments each. Task is to analyze the differential pressure accross the compartments and establish a neural network correlating the pressure with factors such as:
1)Coal Flow(Tonnes per hour)
2)Induced Draft Fan current(A)
3)Gross Generation(MW)
4)SOV Pressure(Stream pressure of water used to clean each compartment after choking)
